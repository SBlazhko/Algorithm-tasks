A string is a palindrome if it has exactly the same sequence of characters when read left-to-right as it has when read right-to-left. For example, the following strings are palindromes:
"kayak",
"codilitytilidoc",
"neveroddoreven".
A string A is an anagram of a string B if A can be obtained from B by rearranging the characters. For example, in each of the following pairs one string is an anagram of the other:
"mary" and "army",
"rocketboys" and "octobersky",
"codility" and "codility".
Write a function:
def solution(s)
that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is an anagram of some palindrome and returns 0 otherwise.

For example, given S = "dooernedeevrvn", the function should return 1, because "dooernedeevrvn" is an anagram of the palindrome "neveroddoreven". Given S = "aabcba", the function should return 0, because there is no palindrome such that S is an anagram of it.
